     THREE-SERVER WEB INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGN
================================================

------------------------------------------------
1. REQUEST FLOW

a) Client types www.foobar.com in browser
b) DNS resolves to HAProxy's IP address
c) HAProxy distributes request (Round Robin):
   - Alternates between Server 1 and Server 2
   - Active-Active configuration (both servers handle traffic)
d) Selected server processes request:
   - Nginx handles HTTP REQUEST
   - Application server processes dynamic content
   - Database queries routed to MySQL Primary (writes) or Replica (reads)
e) Response sent back to Client

------------------------------------------------
2. DATABASE CONFIGURATION

MySQL Primary:
  - Handles all write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
  - Maintains binary log of all data changes
  - Replicates changes to Replica node

MySQL Replica:
  - Receives data updates from Primary
  - Handles read operations (SELECT)
  - Provides redundancy
  - Can be promoted if Primary fails

------------------------------------------------
3. INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES

A. Single Points of Failure (SPOF)
   - HAProxy load balancer
   - MySQL Primary node
   - Individual server components

B. Security Issues
   - No firewall protection
   - No HTTPS encryption
   - Exposed ports and services
   - No network segmentation

C. Monitoring Gaps
   - No server health monitoring
   - No performance metrics
   - No error tracking
   - No resource utilization monitoring
   - No automated alerting
